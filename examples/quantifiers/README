Quantifier Instantiater (by David J. Pearce 2013)
==================================================================

This example illustrates a very simple system for instantiating
quantifiers over very simple logical expressions.  An example session:

> $ java -cp ../../src:. Main
> Welcome!
>

Essentially, you type in simple logical and quantified expressions and
it attempts to instantiate the quantifiers as much as possible.
